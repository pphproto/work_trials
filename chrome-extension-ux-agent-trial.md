## What to Build

Build a Chrome extension with an AI agent that analyzes the current webpage to identify UX issues and provide actionable improvement recommendations.

## What the Tool Should Do

- Trigger analysis of the current webpage with one click
- Capture webpage screenshot and analyze DOM structure
- Identify UX problems:
  - Accessibility issues
  - Navigation problems
  - Layout issues
  - Confusing UI elements
  - Poor user flows
  - Unclear labels or messaging
- Display findings in the extension popup
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Handle different page types and structures

## Tech Stack

- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- TypeScript
- LangChain/LangGraph for AI orchestration
- Gemini 2.5 Flash for LLM (no need to share API keys in submission)

## Submission

1. Push code to a GitHub repository
2. Include detailed instructions on how to run your code (deployment is optional, not required)
3. Include a `NOTES.md` file with:
   - high level design
   - any instructions to run
   - what issues you forsee which needs to be taken care of in the productionised version of the tool
4. **If you used AI tools** (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.), export and include your chat history so we can evaluate the prompts used to generate code

**Note:** We highly recommend using AI copilots (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) to complete this trial efficiently. If you're unable to complete the implementation, you can still submit your work. In your `NOTES.md`, document what you attempted, what worked, what didn't, and why. We evaluate based on effort, problem-solving approach, and the progress you made—not just the final outcome.
