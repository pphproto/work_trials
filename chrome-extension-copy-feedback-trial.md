## What to Build

Build a Chrome extension that analyzes website copy and provides actionable feedback to improve messaging, clarity, and engagement.

## What the Tool Should Do

- Extract copy from the current webpage (headlines, CTAs, value propositions, body text)
- Analyze the copy using an LLM to identify issues like:
  - Unclear value propositions
  - Weak CTAs
  - Jargon or complex language
  - Inconsistent tone
  - Poor readability
- Display analysis results in an extension popup
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions


## Tech Stack

- Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- TypeScript
- React for UI components
- LangChain/LangGraph for AI orchestration
- Gemini 2.5 Flash for LLM (no need to share API keys in submission)

## Submission

1. Push code to a GitHub repository
2. Include detailed instructions on how to run your code (deployment is optional, not required)
3. Include a `NOTES.md` file with:
   - high level design
   - any instructions to run
   - what issues you forsee which needs to be taken care of in the productionised version of the tool
4. **If you used AI tools** (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.), export and include your chat history so we can evaluate the prompts used to generate code

**Note:** We highly recommend using AI copilots (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) to complete this trial efficiently. If you're unable to complete the implementation, you can still submit your work. In your `NOTES.md`, document what you attempted, what worked, what didn't, and why. We evaluate based on effort, problem-solving approach, and the progress you made—not just the final outcome.
