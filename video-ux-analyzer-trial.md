## What to Build

Build an AI-powered tool that analyzes product demo videos and identifies UX issues. Users upload a product demo video, and the system analyzes it to detect usability problems, interaction issues, and areas for improvement.

## What the Tool Should Do

- Accept video uploads (product demo videos, 1-5 minutes)
- Process video content using vision-capable LLMs
- Identify UX issues in product demos:
  - Navigation problems
  - Confusing UI elements
  - Poor user flows
  - Accessibility issues
  - Interaction delays or friction
  - Unclear labels or messaging
- Generate actionable recommendations
- Display video playback with AI-generated UX analysis


## Tech Stack

- Next.js for frontend/API
- TypeScript
- LangChain/LangGraph for AI orchestration
- Gemini 2.5 Flash for LLM (no need to share API keys in submission)

## Submission

1. Push code to a GitHub repository
2. Include detailed instructions on how to run your code (deployment is optional, not required)
3. Include a `NOTES.md` file with:
   - high level design
   - any instructions to run
   - what issues you forsee which needs to be taken care of in the productionised version of the tool
4. **If you used AI tools** (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.), export and include your chat history so we can evaluate the prompts used to generate code

**Note:** We highly recommend using AI copilots (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) to complete this trial efficiently. If you're unable to complete the implementation, you can still submit your work. In your `NOTES.md`, document what you attempted, what worked, what didn't, and why. We evaluate based on effort, problem-solving approach, and the progress you made—not just the final outcome.
