## What to Build

Build an AI-powered tool that analyzes product/service information from a URL and generates comprehensive user personas.

## What the Tool Should Do

- Accept a URL input (website or landing page)
- Extract and analyze product information from the URL
- Generate a comprehensive product profile
- Create an ideal customer profile (ICP)
- Produce 3-5 detailed user personas with:
  - Demographics
  - Goals and motivations
  - Pain points
  - Behaviors and preferences
  - Use cases
- Display outputs in an organized, readable format
- Allow export or save of personas

## Tech Stack

- Next.js for frontend/API
- TypeScript
- LangChain/LangGraph for AI orchestration
- Gemini 2.5 Flash for LLM (no need to share API keys in submission)

## Submission

1. Push code to a GitHub repository
2. Include detailed instructions on how to run your code (deployment is optional, not required)
3. Include a `NOTES.md` file with:
   - high level design
   - any instructions to run
   - what issues you forsee which needs to be taken care of in the productionised version of the tool
4. **If you used AI tools** (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.), export and include your chat history so we can evaluate the prompts used to generate code

**Note:** We highly recommend using AI copilots (Claude, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) to complete this trial efficiently. If you're unable to complete the implementation, you can still submit your work. In your `NOTES.md`, document what you attempted, what worked, what didn't, and why. We evaluate based on effort, problem-solving approach, and the progress you made—not just the final outcome.
